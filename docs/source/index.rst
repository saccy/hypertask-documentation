Hypertask documentation
=======================

Hypertask is a frontend that allows you to productize your Azure Pipelines.
By integrating with PayPal, customers can pay to run your Azure Pipelines via a one-off transaction or as a monthly recurring subscription fee.
You can also allow customers to run your pipelines for free.

In the future, additional compute backends (i.e. AWS Lambda) and additional payment providers (i.e. stripe) will be added.
