PayPal
======

The PayPal integration allows customers to pay you to run your Azure Pipelines.

You can import PayPal information and also create PayPal subscription plans via Hypertask.

Navigate to the ``Integrations`` view, select PayPal from the dropdown and then select ``Add PayPal account``. You will need to provide your PayPal client ID and secret. You can generate these via the `PayPal developer portal <https://developer.paypal.com/home>`_

After adding an account you can create a subscription plan if required by selecting the PayPal account and then selecting ``Create subscription plan``.
